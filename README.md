# android_frog_list
First Android project getting and displaying data from an Api in ListView (List of Amphibians).. because who doesn't like frogs ;-)

This was my first "full" android app, after only having done Java for a week, and only having worked with Anroid Studio for a few days.
Fetched and displayed data from an api in a ListView, also using Picasso to display images.

Added an activity that displays a new page when an item in the listview is clicked on, displaying the info for that particular item.
